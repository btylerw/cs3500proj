    '''
    pawnMoves(nodePosition, grid) is a function that holds the possible Pawn Moves based on the chosen piece 
    within the grid. Should return a list with the coordinates of possible moves that are possible. This function 
    typically gets called in the HighlightpotentialMoves() and resetColours() functions. Will update this docstring 
    when there is a better understanding of this this function will fit into generate moves per piece
